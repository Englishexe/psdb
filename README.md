<p><b>Modules</b><br>Before using PSDB run "install.bat" this will use PIP to install all required modules.<p>
<p><b>PSDB.settings</b><br><s>Settings are formatted like "<code>setting0</code>" the "<code>setting</code>" would be the name <small>(like "networking")</small> and "<code>0</code>" is the value so in this case the setting "setting" is disabled. If it was enabled it would be "<code>setting1</code>". In a future update this will become a long string of characters.</s></p>

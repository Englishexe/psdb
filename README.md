<h3><u>How PSDB works</u></h3>
<p><u>Note: PSDB is in ALPHA meaning alot of things could change.</u> PSDB works by a folder named "<code>databases</code>" filled with files, each file is a database (Find out about database files in the Docs). Once a database is opened with <code>pythondatabase.opendb()</code> it is loaded into memory until closed (<code>pythondatabase.closedb()</code>) or another database is opened.</p>
